# AutoCad-3D
This project showcases a 3D house plan and plan of a hotel building, designed using AutoCAD, where I developed a detailed architectural model of a residential house and buildings. The design includes all essential elements such as walls, rooms, windows, and doors, with a focus on spatial arrangement and structural integrity. The 3D model allows for a comprehensive visualization of the space, providing a realistic representation of the layout and interior design. This project highlights my ability to use AutoCAD for both 2D drafting and 3D modeling, emphasizing creativity and technical skills in architectural design.
